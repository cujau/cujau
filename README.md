# CUJAU - Common Utilities for Java Appliation Use

Cujau is a set of common utility Java classes that are useful to almost any application.

Many similar classes and features of Cujau can be found in other libraries, such as the Apache Commons. However, the classes here are the ones that I have found to be the most useful to my needs. By using Cujau as a dependency rather than any number of Apache Commons classes, the application's footprint can be reduced as unneeded code is not included.

Here's just a sample of some of the utility classes included in Cujau:

* Base64
* CalendarUtil
* ExceptionUtil
* FileUtil
* MultiHashMap
* ReflectionUtil
* ResourceUtil
* SimpleCryptoUtil
* ThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat
* TimingUtil
* XMLUtil
* and many more!

### Build and Dependencies

Cujau is built with Maven. The Cujau JAR only depends on slf4j-api.
